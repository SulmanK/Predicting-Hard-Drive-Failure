## Objective
* Complete Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Predict hard drive failure using additional smart statistics.

## Background Information
* Data is an integral component of our society. From the simple caloric deficits collected in your apple watch to the user history in your Netflix account, data is used in a myriad of applications. With such an abundance of data being used daily, how is it stored? The solution is computer backup or cloud storage services. Furthermore, Backblaze is a world leader in computer backup and storage.  Since 2013, Backblaze has published statistics and insights based on the hard drives in their data center [1].  In this study, weâ€™ll explore various features in a hard drive dataset to predict hard drive failure.

## Process:
* Exploratory Data Analysis conducted utilizing various python packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Plotly).'

* Binary Classification Algorithms (Sci-Kit Learn)
    * Logistic Regression
